# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as

# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)

  # Number of lines/columns (not pixels) in the terminal. The number of columns
  # must be at least `2`, while using a value of `0` for columns and lines will
  # fall back to the window manager's recommended size.
